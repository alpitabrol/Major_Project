which will keep a full-on track what exactly you have bought in your 
grocery every time and what you have to buy next time for your grocery.

This whole guide will emphasize on the concept of balance of every portion required for your bodyâ€™s nutritional needs. This project will allow user to get the nutritional information and guidance to follow a food pyramid by just clicking a picture. On the basis of how much grocery shopping has done in a visit, it will describe the user that he has to come again for the shopping along with the options of what he has to buy next time to complete his nutrition value for the week.

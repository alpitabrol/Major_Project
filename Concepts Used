Basically,There are three concepts have been used in this product.

1.5-A-Day Concept:
This product will focus on the 5-a-day concept. 

2.PLU Codes: 
PLU or Price Look Up codes have been used by supermarkets since 1990 to make check-out 
and inventory control easier, faster and more accurate.
PLU codes are assigned to fruits and vegetables following a rigorous review process conducted by the International
Federation for Produce Standards (IFPS).Like the industry standardized UPCs,
a block of PLU numbers have been reserved for every fruit and vegatables in Canada.PLU numbers are printed on a 
small label that is attached directly to individual fruits and vegetables. They consist of a four or five digit number. 
Four digit PLUs identify conventionally grown fruits and vegetables while a 9 is added at the beginning of the PLU
to identify the item as organic.

For Example: 4011 identifies a conventionally grown banana and 94011 identifies an organically grown banana.

3.OCR
 (Optical Character Recognition) 
is the use of technology to distinguish printed or handwritten text 
characters inside digital images of physical documents, such as a scanned paper document. The basic process of OCR
involves examining the text of a document and translating the characters into 
code that can be used for data processing. OCR is sometimes also referred to as recognition of text.

We will be using the google API named "Google Vision" to work on the above mentioned process of OCR.
